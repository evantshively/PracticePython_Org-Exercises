The goal of this gitHub is to work through each exercise found on:
https://www.practicepython.org/

And to include step by step instructions to help myself and others
to understand Python.

''' Exercise 1: 
    Create a program that asks the user to enter their name 
    and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that 
    tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old. '''

# First step is to get the user to enter their name
# I include an introduction and use the input() function

print("Hello and welcome to this practice python exercise")
name = input('Please enter your name: ')

# To test if your input was saved use the print function to call the variable
print("Hello " + name + "!")

# Second step is to ask for the user age
# We want to make sure that the user input is an integer 
# With an integer we can do math to get to correct year 

age = int(input('What is your age: '))

#Let us call the variable and see if it saved
print(age)

# Let's also test that we do in fact have an integer
# We will use the type() function
print(type(age))

''' The final part of this question is to tell the user when
they will turn 100 years old using their inputed age.
This question takes a little math. '''

# We will be adding the age - 100 to the current year to get the answer

# What is the current year

currentYear = 2021

# creating the answer variable using our formula
# notice the str this transforms the variable into a string
# this makes it easier to print the answer for the user

yearOld = str(currentYear + (100 - age))

# Finally we print the final answer for the user 

print(name + " You will turn 100 in the year " + yearOld)

''' We can also replace the current year using the datetime

'''

print()


''' Exercise 2:
    Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the
    number is even or odd, print out an appropriate 
    message to the user. 
    Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently
    when divided by 2? '''

# I always begin with an introduction
print('Welcome to the Even Odd Number Calculator')

#First step is to get a number from the user
# We want this number to be an integer

number = int(input('Please enter a number: '))

# Second Step determine if number is Even or Odd and 
# print a response to the user

''' One of the best ways to determine if a number is Even
or odd is to use the % which returns the remainder of 
the divison '''

# This stores the remainder of the number 

modNumber = number % 2 

# We will use an if loop to create this function

if modNumber > 0:
    print('Your number is Odd')
else:
    print('Your number is even')

#this if loop uses two conditions depending on if the 
#number input is odd or even. 

print()
print()


'''Exercise 3:
    Take a list, say for example this one:

  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
and write a program that prints out all the elements 
of the list that are less than 5. '''

#First some basics before we solve the problem 

#Creating a list 

x = [] # This is an empty list

#adding to a list 

x.append(3) # this adds the element 3 to our empty list

#loops can be used in conjuction with lists 

testList = [1, 2, 5, "Evan", "Katie", "Zelda"]

for element in testList:
    print(element)

#Now let's return to the problem, first we create the list

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

# We will now create a loop to print all elements in a < 5

for number in a: # number becomes our item for the function
    if number < 5: # this is our if filter 
        print(number)
    else: # for all other situation we use the pass command to skip that output
        pass

# How to write this function in one line

print([aa for aa in a if aa < 5])

''' 
Exercise 4:

Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors
of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. 
For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

'''

print("Hello this program will print a list of all divisors for a given user number")
print()

userNumber = int(input("Please enter a number: "))

userRange = list(range(1,userNumber+1))

divisorList = []  # blank list to fill with divisors

for number in userRange:
    if userNumber % number == 0:
        divisorList.append(number)

print(divisorList)
