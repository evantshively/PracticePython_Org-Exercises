# PracticePython_Org-Exercises
Practicepython.org is a great site that provides several practice exercises for learning Python. This GitHub is created for my own benefit 
and for the benefit of others who are working through these exercises while learning python. Comments are provided throughout as
well as solution for each exercise.
