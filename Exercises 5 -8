Exercise 5 

Take two lists, say for example these two:

  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
  b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.

Extras:

Randomly generate two lists to test this
Write this in one line of Python (don’t worry if you can’t figure this out at this point - we’ll get to it soon)

'''

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

print(5 in a)
print (5 in (a and b))

testList = a + b

answerList = []

for both in testList:
    if both in () 

'''
Exercise 6

Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not. 
(A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.)

String is a variable type which is made up of characters

'''
#First step is to ask the user for a word

userWord = input(str("Hello, Please Enter a Word: "))  
#Use Str function here to make sure it is a string

userWord = lower(userWord)
#This makes sure that if the user implements captials it will not matter


#Second step we want to do is reverse the word


wordBack = userWord[::-1]

#To check the word is correctly reversed
print(wordBack)

#Finally we wish to compare the users word with the reverse to test if they are the same
#We want to also let the user know of the results 

if userWord == wordBack:
    print("Your word is a Palindrome")
else:
    print("Your word is not a Palindrome, Sorry")

'''
Exercise 7

Let’s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. 
Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.

'''
#our original List

a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]

#Using if statement in one line
#New element now saved as a
# %2 == 0 as a way to check if a number is even
#Psuedo: new variable b for every data point in a who does not leave a reminder when dividing by 2 

a = [b for b in a if b %2 == 0]

#Check result
print(a)

'''
Exercise 8

Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game. (Hint: Ask for player plays (using input), compare them, print out a message of congratulations to the winner, and ask if the players want to start a new game)

Remember the rules:

Rock beats scissors
Scissors beats paper
Paper beats rock
